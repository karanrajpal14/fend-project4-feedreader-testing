# Feed Reader Testing - Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Project #4

In this project we test a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. We use [Jasmine][1] to test various aspects of the application.

## Objective

We test if the feed has:
1. attributes like name and url
2. a menu is hidden by default and toggleable
3. successfully loaded the content
4. sucessfully loaded new content when the feed changes

## Instructions

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `index.html`
3. Check footer to ensure all tests are passing
4. Edit `/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js` to add/modify the tests
